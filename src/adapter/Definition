Adapter pattern converts the interface of a class 
into the interface the client expects.

Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't
otherwise because of incopatible interfaces.

It decouples the client from the adaptee.
If the adaptee interface changes, the adapter
encapsulates the change so the client need not
be modified every time it has to work againts 
a different interface.
